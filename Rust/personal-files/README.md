# Personal Files

A native **Rust + GTK 3 application for Ubuntu**, inspired by Finder. Your
favorite, recent, and frequent directories are one click away. Hidden files
are always visible.

## Run

Open **Personal Files** from Ubuntu's application menu after installation, or:

```bash
~/.local/bin/personal-files
~/.local/bin/personal-files /path/to/a/folder
```

From this directory, `./launch.sh` runs the cached release build and builds it
if missing. `./install.sh` builds and installs it for the current user. No sudo
is needed for installation, and it does not replace Ubuntu's default Files app.

## Use

- Paste a path into the always-visible bar and press **Enter**. Absolute paths,
  `~/…`, and paths relative to the current folder work. A file path opens its
  parent and selects the file. **Ctrl+L** focuses the bar.
- Click **☆** or press **Ctrl+D** to pin/unpin the current folder. Right-click
  folders for **Add to Favorites**, or drag folders into the sidebar. Click a
  saved place to open it; hover to see its full path.
- **Recent** automatically remembers your latest seven places; **Frequent**
  shows five places ranked by visit count and recency. Both survive restart.
  Automatic history never silently changes your manual Favorites.
- Click **Name**, **Modified**, or **Size** to sort; click again to reverse.
  Folders remain first. Their size is shown as “—” rather than a recursive total.
- Select one or more files/folders and use **Ctrl+C**, the Copy button or
  **Copy Full Path** in the context menu. With nothing selected, the Copy button
  copies the current directory. **Ctrl+Shift+C** / **Copy Shell-Quoted Path**
  safely quotes each path for a POSIX terminal. Text copying within the path bar
  retains normal text-entry behavior.
- **Alt+Left/Right** goes back/forward; **Alt+Up** opens the parent.
  **Ctrl+R** or **F5** refreshes. Local folder changes also refresh automatically.
- Double-click or press **Enter** to open a folder/document. Documents use
  Ubuntu's registered default application.
- **Appearance** offers Silver, Midnight, Aurora and Automatic skins, plus a
  background image picker. Automatic uses file extensions, not document content:
  mostly pictures → Aurora; mostly code → Midnight; otherwise Silver.
- **Appearance → Clear Visit History** clears automatic places and keeps your
  explicit favorites. The shortcuts menu provides the keyboard reference.

State is local at `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/personal-files/preferences.json` (normally
`~/.config/personal-files/preferences.json`). It contains visited paths, favorites,
sort and appearance settings; it is saved atomically with mode 0600. Invalid
state is backed up before recovery. No telemetry, content uploads, or background
network service. Browsing and favoriting do not rename, move or delete files.

## Build and verify

Requires Rust/Cargo and the Ubuntu GTK 3 runtime. A fresh build also needs:

```bash
sudo apt install libgtk-3-dev pkg-config build-essential
./build.sh
cargo test --locked
cargo test --locked desktop_story -- --ignored --nocapture
```

The last command needs a graphical display (or `xvfb-run`). Its fixture windows
and preferences are temporary. Ordinary `cargo test` intentionally ignores that
test; it must be run explicitly for desktop evidence. Physical pointer-driven
drag interoperability is separate from the tested URI/drop handlers.

`build.sh` defaults build output to `~/.cache/personal-files/target` and respects
`CARGO_TARGET_DIR`. On the development machine it can also use GTK development
files extracted under `~/.cache/personal-files/gtk-dev`, without system package
installation. For direct Cargo commands on that machine, export:

```bash
export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="$HOME/.cache/personal-files/gtk-dev/usr/lib/$(gcc -print-multiarch)/pkgconfig${PKG_CONFIG_PATH:+:$PKG_CONFIG_PATH}"
export CARGO_TARGET_DIR="$HOME/.cache/personal-files/target"
```

## PDD

The reviewed story is in `user_stories/story__personal_places.md`; versioned
`.prompt` files and `architecture.json` map the implementation. See
`docs/PRODUCT_INTENT.md` for decisions and `docs/VERIFICATION.md` for exact
verification scope and the interrupted automated PDD run. The initial Python
reference was used for porting and is not a maintained project or dependency.

This first iteration targets Ubuntu only. A macOS version is a separate project.
